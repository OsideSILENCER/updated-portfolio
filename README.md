Updated portfolio

This is a portfolio of my future. Its not the best and far from perfect but I tried.

My motivation for this portfolio and being here is still to become somthing better in life, nothings changed.
I created this portfolio to try and gage my skills.
I learned that when it comes to HTML and CSS the possibilities are infifinite in terms of creating a page and we all have a long way to go, although I can admit that I'm getting better.

The steps it took to install this portfolio was hours of fixing html and css and as you can see i still can't make the images folder connect ot the css folder. I will eventually get this down.
