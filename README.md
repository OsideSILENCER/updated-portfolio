Updated portfolio #2

This is a portfolio of my future and i admit its getting better and better. I'm now a fullstack developer and although I still have a lot to learn i feel that there's finally hope in life.

My motivation for this portfolio and being here is still to become somthing better in life, nothings changed.
I
 created this portfolio to show case my acooomplishments and skills.

I learned that when it comes to  building a fully functioning website HTML and CSS were basic learning apparatus and are replaced with handlebars and api's. The possibilities are truly infifinite in terms of creating a page and although we all still have a long way to go, I can admit that I have gotten better.

The steps it took to install this portfolio was hours of updating information and as you can see the portfolio page noticably looks different than it used to.
